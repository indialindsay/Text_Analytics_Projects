## Brand/Attribute Discussion Forum Analysis
#### Web-scraped an online discussion forum of luxury sedan car brands and calculated associations between brands and product attributes within 5000 posts

- Calculated how likely one brand is to be mentioned in association with another brand. Notable associations:
  - Honda and Toyota. As these brands are similar in models offered, quality, and affordability, indicates that users may be debating between these two brands
  - Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen. Mercedes is a luxury brand while Volkswagen is not, indicating that consumers may be comparing these brands in quality while offering Volkswagen as an affordable option.
  - Lexus and Mercedes Benz. These two brands can be considered the closest substitutes out of all luxury sedan brands and may be competing for a shared consumer base. 
- Most frequently mentioned car attributes were performance, luxury, engine, price, and power.   
  - In terms of luxury, Lexus had the highest association and BMW had the lowest
  - Honda had the highest association with price, power, and engine; indicates Honda may offer comparative quality to luxury brands in these areas 
- Built an MDS map to visualize lifts between car brands.
  - Identified a cluster of affordable substitude brands: Volkswagen, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan 
- Honda was only affordable brand within top 5 most frequently mentioned brands 
- Volkwagen had the greatest association with aspirational words (words indicative of a users desire to purchase or obtain)
